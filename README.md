# SC2-Python-Bot
## Preface
Team project to implement a full AI for Starcraft II, utilizing reinforcement learning through the use of the Q-Learning Algorithm and a great deal of abstraction. This is accomplished by utilizing DeepMindâ€™s pysc2, the Python component of the StarCraft II Learning Environment, which provides an interface for RL agents to interact with StarCraft II.<br />

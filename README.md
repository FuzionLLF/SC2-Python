# SC2-Python-Bot
## Preface
Team project to implement a full AI for Starcraft II, utilizing reinforcement learning through the use of the Q-Learning Algorithm and a great deal of abstraction. This is accomplished by utilizing DeepMindâ€™s pysc2, the Python component of the StarCraft II Learning Environment, which provides an interface for RL agents to interact with StarCraft II.<br />

PySC2 : https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2<br />
Project Report : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YQh0klm4oo-cFp7O4mQ0cFkNpNQ-A1dFLH_04aUbi9g/<br />

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.



### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Install Starcraft 2
Install the latest version of python
Install Pycharm
Install PySC2
```

### Installing

#### Follow the procedure laid out in Deepmind's documentation to run PySC2
https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2

#### Clone our repository

```
$ git clone https://github.com/GregoryPrograms/SC2-Python.git
```

#### Once Everything is downloaded, you can run our bot

## Bot Overview

### [Botty_McBotface.py](https://github.com/GregoryPrograms/SC2-Python/blob/master/src/Botty_McBotface.py)

#### Controls what information is passed to and from the AI.
```Python
class Botty(base_agent.BaseAgent):
```

##### Constructor for our bot. It initializes the AI, passes it actions and gamestate
```Python
    def __init__(self):
        super(Botty, self).__init__()
        self.strategy_manager = RLBrain(smart_actions)  # keeping default rates for now.
        self.state = GameState()

        # if we want to have predefined initialization actions, we can hard code values in here.
        self.action_list = []
        self.prev_action = None
        self.prev_state = None
        self.prev_killed_units = 0
        self.prev_value_units = 0
        self.prev_mineral_rate = 0
        self.prev_vespene_rate = 0
        self.base = 'right'
        self.building_queue = BuildingQueue()
        self.unit_queue = UnitQueue()
        self.research_queue = ResearchQueue()
```
##### Initializes the base location of our bot
```Python
def init_base(self, obs):
```
##### This step function will:
1. Reduce state.
2. Allow brain to learn based on previous actions, states, & rewards
3. Choose an action based on current state.
4. Update the previous actions & state.
5. Do action.
```Python
def step(self, obs):
```
##### Makes it so that building will not be built directly near each other
```Python
building_offsets = {...}
```

##### Methods
```Python
# Takes information about the current game state, creates a 'reward'
# A reward is based on how good the current state is, and it gets passed to the Brain.
def reward_and_learn(self, obs):

# Takes in actions and if an action needs specific parameters, it passes those to it.
def get_action_list(self, action_str, obs):

# Whenever we build a building, we call this function. If it is a 
# building with special requirements, we fullfill those requirements 
# We also use offset to make sure the building does not overlap with any other buildings.
def get_building_target(obs, building):

# Called in order to move a set of coordinates by some distance, depending
# on whether the base is on the right or left side of the map. 
def transform_location(self, x, x_distance, y, y_distance):
```


### [RLBrain.py](https://github.com/GregoryPrograms/SC2-Python/blob/master/src/RLBrain.py)
#### Q-Learning attempts to learn the value of being in a given state, and taking a specific action there. This was implemented with the help of panda(open-source library that provides easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools) and numpy(undamental package for scientific computing)
```Python
class RLBrain:
```

#### The init method for the brain.
```Python
def __init__(self, reduced_actions=None, decay_rate=0.1):
        self.actions = reduced_actions  # list of actions
        self.QTable = pd.DataFrame(columns=self.actions, dtype=np.float64)
        self.learn_rate = self.learning(0)
        self.decay_rate = decay_rate
        self.rand_rate = self.explore(0)
```
#### Methods
```Python
#This method chooses which action to do and returns that action
def choose_action(self, state):

#This method gets new state and reward from the environment
def add_state(self, state):

#finds a max value and then it gets passed onto rand_rate
def explore(self, t):

#returns max value and then it gets passed onto learn_rate
def learning(self, t):

#This uses given information to update the q-table
def learn(self, state, next_state, action, reward):
```
### [Actions.py](https://github.com/GregoryPrograms/SC2-Python/blob/master/src/actions.py)
#### Actions that are used by our bot
```Python

#no operational action
def no_op():

# @param obs: The observation map
# @param building: The building being built
# @param target: The location that the building is being built at
#builds the next building determined by the build order
def build_building(obs, building, target):

# @param unit: The unit being built
# Takes a unit from the build queue and builds that unit.
def build_units(unit):

# @param drone_func Function to build a drone from available larvae.
# Makes a new drone.
def build_worker(drone_func):


# research
# @param research_func Function to start researching
# Starts research on the next thing in the research queue.
def research(research_func):

# View control

# chooses x and y location to move to. Allows bot to see more
def moveview(x, y):

# @param obs The observation maps
# Looks for enemies, and attacks them.
def attack(obs):

# check to see if enemy units are too close. As such, this function is a simpler version of attack.
def defend(x_defend, y_defend):

# return_to_base(rally_x,rally_y)
# @param rally_x x location for the units to move to.
# @param rally_y y location for the units to move to.
# Takes in some point on the map, and moves army to that point. 
# Meant to be used to move army to base, but can be used to move army anywhere.
def return_to_base(rally_x, rally_y):
```
